    <p>On June 27, 1988, Tyson faced Michael Spinks. Spinks, who had taken the heavyweight championship from Larry Holmes via
    fifteen-round decision in 1985, had not lost his title in the ring but was not recognized as champion by the major boxing 
    organizations. Holmes had previously given up all but the IBF title, and that was eventually stripped from Spinks after he 
    elected to fight Gerry Cooney (winning by TKO in the fifth round) rather than IBF Number 1 Contender Tony Tucker, as the 
    Cooney fight provided him a larger purse. However, Spinks did become the lineal champion by beating Holmes and many  
    (including Ring magazine) considered him to have a legitimate claim to being the true heavyweight champion.[49] The bout was,
    at the time, the richest fight in history and expectations were very high. Boxing pundits were predicting a titanic battle 
    of styles, with Tyson's aggressive infighting conflicting with Spinks's skillful out-boxing and footwork. The fight ended
    after 91 seconds when Tyson knocked Spinks out in the first round; many consider this to be the pinnacle of Tyson's fame 
    and boxing ability.[50][51]</p>
